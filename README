How to upload an AS project:

DO NOT UPLOAD THE ENTIRE PROJECT FOLDER. Seriously, it's huge. Just don't do it, kthx.

Open up AndroidStudioProjects folder.

... /AndroidStudioProjects/PROJECTNAME/app/src/main/

INSIDE /main/, you'll see folders named "java" and "res," and the manifest file. You can upload the manifest from here.

Go into java and keep clicking through until you actually find the java files. 

/java/.../.../.../stateplatebingo/

Upload the java files from there.

Next, go back to main/ and open up res/.

Things to upload from res:

DRAWABLE: things you added/changed (gridbutton.XML, gridshape.XML, etc)
LAYOUT: anything you've edited
VALUES: styles, strings, colors
