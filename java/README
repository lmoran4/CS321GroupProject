Whenever you see something like...

package com.example.leila.stateplatebingo

Change the package name to whatever your package is.

package com.example.WHATEVER.stateplatebingo

Also, MAKE SURE your project is also named StatePlateBingo when you create it in android studio. Yes, with the capitalized letters,
even though it's all lowercase in the package.

If you look in your files:

... /AndroidStudioProject/StatePlateBingo/...

StatePlateBingo should be a folder.


ALSO, IN ANDROID STUDIO, DON'T STICK ANY JAVA FILES IN THE FOLDERS TAGGED WITH (test), (androidTest). Just stick them
under the untagged folder.
